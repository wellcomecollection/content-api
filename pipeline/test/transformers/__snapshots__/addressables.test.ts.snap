      "Dorothée King has experienced menstrual discomfort for over 20 years, but nothing quite prepared her for when a tampon got stuck. Dorothée shares the absurd story of how she juggled her commitments as a partner and parent, on holiday abroad, while attempting to get the stuck tampon out.",
      "Summer holidays in Amsterdam. Colin is working at the university. The kids and I are in our lovely holiday apartment. Canal views and everything. We sit at the kitchen island. My son is reading. I am playing cards with my daughter. ",
      "I feel a puddle on my IKEA highchair. I check with my fingers and see that there is blood on my chair and my pyjamas. ",
      "As I don’t want to disturb my card game with my daughter, I tell her that I will run to the bathroom quickly and then continue. Hastily I push a tampon up my vagina. I return to play on for another half an hour.  ",
      "We hang out in the apartment for a while. Then we head out to meet an old friend and her family for ice cream. I enjoy myself and the nice sunny day and forget all about the tampon. It must have been the last day of my period anyway.",
      "That evening we have a dinner party at the holiday apartment with Colin’s colleague and their family. I remember the tampon. ",
      "I go to the bathroom. I squat, reach for the string, but nothing. I can’t find it. Anywhere. ",
      "Only now do I realise that in my rush to get back to the card game, I must have pushed the tampon in without pulling out the string. Five minutes of fiddling around with multiple fingers in multiple positions leads to no result. ",
      "Colin is washing the vegetables. Talking over the kitchen island, I tell him about my miserable situation. We laugh about it, and then turn towards our guests. We spend a nice evening together, eating risotto and playing with the children. Around 22:00 our guests are gone, and our kids are finally asleep. ",
      "Tongs, tea and tampon trouble",
      "I remember the tampon again. I go to the toilet. Another round of squatting, squeezing, pressing, trying to recall giving birth. Nothing. Colin offers his help. He feels that his hands must be clean enough after just washing the dishes. I lie down on the bed. I explain to him the approximate location of the tampon: not too high up, maybe three inches in, more to my left. ",
      "What happens next isn't sexy or erotic. Colin moves my legs up, opens them wide, inserts two cold fingers inside my vagina and fumbles around. I feel the tampon moving further up and further left. I have never been as dry. Imagine a 12-hour-old tampon.",
      "He can’t find the string either. He walks over to our well-equipped Airbnb kitchen and comes back with a pair of long, pointed tongs for the grill. I deny him the usage of such a tool. I decide to try the anti-inflammatory qualities of green tea instead. I almost burn myself while I try to push my hot-green-tea fingers towards what I think could be the string of the tampon.",
      "After this further unsuccessful attempt, Colin and I begin to google words like “tampon lost”, “string nowhere to be found”, or “Dutch emergency gynaecologist with lost object expertise”. Via an online interface I book myself a 12:00 appointment for the next day at the Amsterdam expat medical-care centre and go to bed. I feel that the tampon must have quadrupled in size by now. I can’t sleep on either side of my body. ",
      "Hide and seek",
      "I get up at six in the morning after a restless night. Colin is already sitting at the dining-room table. He is working on his book on argumentation theory while watching the early birds on the canals. ",
      "After one more unsuccessful attempt to press out the unwanted and overused object, I ask Colin for his help again. This time we try the living-room couch. I move my hips to the edge of the sofa as if I am lying on a gynaecologist’s chair and lift my legs high up in the air. ",
      "I ask Colin to look up into my vagina, but even with his glasses on, it is impossible for him to peek inside my body. After another round of painful squeezing, pushing and turning with various fingers, I feel like I will never enjoy any kind of sexual interaction ever again. We give up. ",
      "At nine o’clock the kids are enjoying their chocolate-covered cereal at the kitchen island. I call the expat/tourist medical-care centre to ask for an earlier appointment. I expect an endless please-hold-the-line experience, but instead I talk to a very friendly assistant who understands my situation instantly. She offers to move my appointment up to 10:30. She even asks if I would prefer a female assistant instead of a male doctor. I gladly agree to both. ",
      "The kids ask about the phone call. My daughter makes a painful face. My son shrugs his shoulders and tells me to see a doctor and returns to his book. I hurry them out of the house to get to the appointment on time. ",
      "After a 30-minute walk, we arrive at the shabby-looking medical-care centre. A woman with a headset, face mask and a lot of paperwork in her arms checks me in. I am glad they accept my health-insurance card. While I am sitting and waiting, I look at a giant vertical screen in front of me and learn a lot about rheumatism and incontinence in Dutch. ",
      "The friendly assistant calls my name and I follow her into a tiny examination room. “So, you are the one with the tampon?” It turns out she was who I talked with earlier on the phone. She will be the one helping me to remove the tampon. ",
      "I follow her request to take off my trousers and underwear. I lie down on the little examination table. “Are you sure there is a tampon?” she asks. “Is this your first time in Amsterdam?” She lures me into a mix of medical information and small talk. ",
      "I trust her. I begin to relax. She pushes a huge metal object into my vagina that resembles a giant shoehorn. The next tool she gets are huge tweezers, even bigger than the kitchen tongs Colin found.",
      "I try to remember to apply deep tummy breathing, a technique I learned once in an online breathwork course. At the same time, I squeeze the skin on my right arm with the fingers of my left hand to feel some additional pain somewhere outside my uterus. ",
      "The shoehorn is in by now. The tips of the tweezers scratch the inner walls of my vagina. I squeak, shrink, move, and the shoehorn slaps out. The friendly assistant confirms what I feared. “The tampon is stuck.” Nonetheless, she convinces me to allow her to try again. ",
      "Unwillingly I slip my hips forward to the edge of the table again. I restart my deep breathing, arm squeezing, and after three minutes more metal-on-flesh experience, the assistant looks up: “All done.” ",
      "I get up and get dressed. I long to see the tampon, but don’t dare to ask. I shower my hero of the day with gratitude. I feel sore but happy. Colin picks me up in front of the medical centre while the kids wait in a café nearby. We are both relieved and enjoy a sunny kiss. ",
      "Colin goes back to the university. I pick up the kids and take them on an afternoon trip to Rotterdam. ",
      "The next time I get my period, I switch to pads. ",

      "Bouba Touré (1948 – 2022) was a Franco-Malian film projectionist, photographer, writer and farmer. He documented the everyday lives of migrants and migrant workers’ movements, such as les sans-papiers (without papers) in Paris. These photographs show street gatherings of citizens from France’s former colonial territories fighting for freedom of movement. Touré honours the migrant-led movements that led to the improvement of workers’ rights and the recognition of thousands of undocumented migrants despite the ongoing rise of hostile immigration laws in France.",

They are often referred to as the Windrush generation, after the ship HMT Empire Windrush on which the first group arrived in 1948.

      "This book shows how Western medicine was used to sustain plantation economies by justifying the importance of slavery in the West Indies. Dr Collins wrote that plantation owners should view medical treatment for enslaved people as an investment. Keeping the workforce ‘healthy’ would lead to an increase in productivity and wealth. The book includes treatments for various infectious diseases, such as yaws and pox, as well as instructions on the management of enslaved people’s housing, food and labour, demonstrating the extreme level of control over their lives.",

      "The Brazilian photographer Marc Ferrez (1843– 1923) documented the rapid transformation of Brazil’s modern urban development and landscapes. He focused on the coffee fazenda, or plantation, that was responsible for the growth of the Brazilian Empire’s wealth in the early 19th century. Fazendas were highly profitable due to their fast production, ideal weather conditions and the rise of migrant labour in the country. This photograph was commissioned by the plantation owner and the Centre for Farming and Commerce to promote coffee production in international exhibitions. The violence of slavery is concealed in this calm scene depicting discipline, order, power and wealth on the plantation.",

Each print depicts different steps in the production of tea, including sowing, cultivation, drying and its exportation from China to Europe. This scene outlines the power dynamics involved in how the work was performed. The authoritarian, symmetrical space reflects the hierarchical relationship between workers’ occupations. These are ordered according to their position, clothing and the striking difference in the physical endurance required for each job.",

Today, workers do not have the right to own land and most work informally, earning an average daily wage of US $1.42 (£1.13). The beautiful landscape conceals the harsh and unsafe working conditions for tea workers. Md Fazla Rabbi Fatiq’s photographs reveal a worker’s hand crushed by a machine for processing tea leaves and an eye injured by harmful pesticides.",

She produced one of the first and most compelling botanicals made by a woman. It includes over 60 colour drawings of plants and their interdependent ecosystem of insects and animals.

Quilombos are settlements created by enslaved Indigenous and African people who escaped the plantation system that date as far back as 400 years ago. Hundreds of quilombos still exist and continue to be inhabited by enslaved people’s descendants and other low-income families. This installation presents 12 pages of her notebook about plants that grow in a communal creole garden by her home. The garden has sustained and nourished generations in their quest for liberation. Quilombos are a symbol of resistance, healing and autonomy, sustaining new structures of work and life away from the inhumanity of forced labour.",

Tubman founded the Underground Railroad, a fragile network of safe houses along the routes that allowed thousands of enslaved people to escape from Southern plantations to the Northern states of the USA. Plants found in the landscapes were fundamental during the escapes. Here, Tubman is pictured resting. She holds a rifle, lying on the hard ground beside a couple and their baby.

At the rear of the temple, images of Saint Sebastian, the orixá of the forests and hunting, and Saint Lazarus, the orixá of health and healing, conceal the African and Indigenous traditions of Umbanda.

      "This song narrates the harsh treatment of enslaved people on a plantation in a direct message to their owners. It was transcribed by British abolitionist Granville Sharp (1735 – 1813) based on information from Scottish abolitionist Dr William Dickson (1751 – 1823), who heard the song while in Barbados. Storytelling through collective singing was an act of survival. Though forbidden to talk while working, enslaved people were permitted to sing in unison, as it was deemed productive by plantation owners and supervisors. Using rhythm and voice, songs contained coded meanings that preserved and shared knowledge and culture from generation to generation.",

      "Along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans in the US state of Louisiana, a heavily industrialised ‘Petrochemical Corridor’ overlays a territory formerly known as ‘Plantation Country’. In the region’s majority-Black communities, residents – descendants of people historically enslaved on the same land – breathe some of the most toxic air in the country and suffer one of the highest risks of cancer and other serious health conditions, yielding the regional name ‘Death Alley’. As industrial development pollutes their air, it also threatens the burial grounds of their ancestors, exposing the continuum of environmental racism in the region. This project seeks to offer new tools to local residents and their allies to protect their history and future from industrial erasure, and to support their vision of a new cultural economy that honours the dead and uplifts the living.",

In the 16th century the mosquito was transported on slave ships from Africa to Brazil and has since spread across the Americas. In this embroidered work, mosquitoes take on a human scale, thriving in the human-made plantation landscape. In Brazil today, rapid deforestation has led to the return of yellow fever. Here, Caccuri invites us to reconsider our relationship with the mosquito, as an insect also affected by histories of colonialism.",

It was initially built with a capacity of 520 isolated cells. Communal spaces such as exercise courtyards and chapels were also separated to discourage social contact among prisoners, causing high rates of depression. Today, Pentonville is overcrowded, with over 1,200 prisoners.",

      "The treadwheel was originally used to generate power for pumping water or manufacturing. In the 19th century it was used as a method of punishment, discipline and unnecessary productivity. This controversial tool enabled prison governors to set daily productivity targets for the number of steps per prisoner per hour. The slide rule encouraged prison authorities to adopt a more uniform system of treadwheel use, as the severity of labour practices varied greatly between prisons.",

In 1975, he spent six months and eight days as a political prisoner at the Kober prison in Khartoum, Sudan, which holds colonial ties to Britain. While in prison, he drew on the paper bags that wrapped the food his family brought him. Drawing put him at risk of punishment or execution, but was an essential way for him to survive the isolation of imprisonment and ease his mental and physical chronic pain.",

      "These paintings are inspired by words found in British health-and-safety manuals combined with the patterns of East African Kanga fabrics. These manuals are intended to protect workers, but also to control them. For Lubaina Himid, this desire for regulation echoes British colonial control. In Magda Stawarska’s accompanying soundtrack, Himid echoes the manual’s words against a background of construction-work sounds.",

Concerned with class, politics and gender, O’Brien’s work questions the effect of work and working-class life on the body.",

Real-life testimonies are interspersed with hidden footage taken while at work. They are seen scrubbing the floor, hoovering, washing and cleaning repeatedly, exposing the exhausting nature of their work. ‘Our Journey’ also reveals the physical and psychological abuse they face. The Voice of Domestic Workers is an education and support group calling for justice and rights for migrant domestic workers in the UK.",

      "Each year over 23,000 people migrate to the UK to work as domestic workers in private households. ‘Care Chains (Love will continue to resonate)’ asks us to consider how giving care is more than just a physical act, but is one that requires emotional labour and compassion.",
      "Care work impacts people’s lives in many ways, both physical and invisible, but also creates a resonance that connects people.",
      "Moi Tran investigates the body as an instrument of communicating care. The installation features footage of 12 women who are domestic workers. Through their percussive body movements, they channel love, joy, healing, the release of tension and collective resistance. The multisensory installation uses synchronised film, light, sound and vibration to create a moment to reflect on universal practices of care.",
