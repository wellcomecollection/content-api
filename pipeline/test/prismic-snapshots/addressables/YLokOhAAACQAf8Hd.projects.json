Examples of the text in a couple of the squares are, 'Hearing my abby laugh is the aim of human existence' and 'Smelling wet earth brings happiness'. In front of the wall are two individuals with their backs to the camera looking at the artwork. Both are wearing face coverings, white tops and dark trousers. The man on the left has his arms folded, the woman on the right has her hands clasped behind her back.\n",
