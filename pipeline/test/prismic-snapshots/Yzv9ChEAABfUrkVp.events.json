They are surrounded by other museum exhibits and display cases. The tapestry is framed with a bright yellow border. Surrounding the tapestry is a wider wooden structure containing seating and alcoves. To the right of the image a gallery visitor reclines in one of the alcoves with her back to the tapestry, in contemplation.
