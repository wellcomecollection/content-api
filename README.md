# Content API

These are the services that back our [Content API](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/api/content). The Content API exposes our non-catalogue content: as of 20204-08-12 that includes articles, events and venues but in the future it might exhibitions, and functional content.

### Services

- `/pipeline`: runs on a schedule, queries Prismic for updated content, transforms it and puts it into an index in the content ES cluster.
- `/api`: queries the Elasticsearch index
- `/webhook`: a Lambda handler exposed via a function URL for handling Prismic webhook events and publishing them to a EventBridge bus
- `/unpublisher`: receives events published by the webhook, extracts document IDs from them and removes them from the ES index.

### Developing

- Deployment is all done in CI, see `.buildkite/pipeline.yml`
- `husky` will set up a pre-commit hook for autoformatting when you first install dependencies
